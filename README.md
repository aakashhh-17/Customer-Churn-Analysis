# Customer-Churn-Analysis
## Objective
The primary goal of this analysis was to identify the factors contributing to customer churn in a telecommunications company. By understanding which factors lead to higher churn rates, the company can implement strategies to improve customer retention and reduce churn.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about customers, including demographic details, subscription services, payment methods, and whether or not they churned. Key attributes include:
* ##Demographic Information:## Age, gender, and customer tenure.
* ##Service Details:## Subscription to various services such as phone service, internet service, and premium services.
* ##Payment Methods:## Methods used for payments (electronic check, credit card, etc.).
* ##Churn:## A binary column indicating whether the customer churned or stayed.

## Key Findings
1. ##Payments impact methods on churn:##
* Customers using electronic checks are significantly more likely to churn compared to those using other payment methods. This could be due to issues with payment convenience or security.
* On the other hand, customers using automatic payment methods such as credit cards or bank transfers are less likely to churn, suggesting these methods are more customer-friendly.
2. ##Customer Churn:##
* Customers with a shorter tenure (less than a year) exhibit a higher churn rate, indicating that customers tend to leave the service early if they are dissatisfied. There is a strong correlation between longer tenure and lower churn, implying that customer loyalty increases over time.
3. ##Service subscription and churn:##
* Certain services, such as premium services, are linked to higher churn rates. Customers subscribed to more premium services show an increased likelihood of leaving, possibly due to the perceived value or pricing of these services.
* Internet service type also plays a role, with customers using fiber optic services showing higher churn rates than those using DSL services.
4. ##Demographics:##
* Senior citizens have a higher churn rate compared to younger customers, suggesting that they may face difficulties with service or pricing, or have different service expectations.
* Gender does not significantly affect churn, indicating that churn-related factors are more dependent on service and payment variables than on gender.

## Recommendations:
Based on the findings, the following actions are recommended:
1. ##Promote Automatic Payment Methods:## Encourage customers to switch from electronic checks to automatic payment methods by offering incentives or simplifying the process.
2. ##Improve Early Customer Experience:## Implement a targeted retention strategy for new customers within their first year, such as personalized customer support, onboarding programs, or discounts, to improve satisfaction and reduce early churn.
3. ##Evaluate and Optimize Premium Services:## Conduct a thorough review of premium services to ensure they meet customer expectations and provide value for money. Adjust pricing or features as necessary to improve customer satisfaction.
4. ##Senior Citizen Retention Program:## Develop a customer service initiative tailored to senior citizens, addressing their unique needs and concerns to help reduce their churn rate.
